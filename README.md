# Genetic Algorithm

This project uses Genetic Algorithm in order to find solutions for TSP, Knapsack, and N-Queens problems.

The project is Dockerized so there are two runner files:

		run_linux.sh" for Linux OS
		run_windows" for Windows OS

## Attention:
Do not forget to run runner files as administrator!

## Dependencies
1. Docker

## Mode
The program is developed in Multi-Process mode.

## Result
The result chart is saved as a png file on your desktop in the "genetic_result" directory.

Enjoy!
