# Genetic Algorithm

This project uses Genetic Algorithm in order to find solutions for TSP, Knapsack, and N-Queens problems.

The project is Dockerized and there are steps in order to run the project:

	Step 1:
		On Linux or Mac OS: ./run_linux.sh
  		On Windows: ./run_windows.bat
	Step 2:
 		sh cmake_runner.sh && ./build/genetic-algorithm

## Attention:
Do not forget to run runner files as administrator!

## Dependencies
1. Docker

## Mode
The program is developed in Multi-Process mode.

## Result
The result chart is saved as a PNG file on your desktop in the "genetic_result" directory.

Enjoy!
